-This is a base building game
-This is your character, you control it by using the w a s d keys
-Your character passively drains energy depending on your difficulty level
-When you run out of energy the game is over

-Your resource stockpiles are here in the right bottom corner of your screen

-You can select buildings to build here in the left bottom corner of your screen
-You can only build buildings next to your character and you can't move through buildings

-It is always a good idea to start of by building a stone mine
-This way, you'll never completely run out of stone to build buildings with , without having a way of getting new stone

-You can now see your resource stockpiles changing
-Now we are gaining stone but losing energy

-Let's do something about that by farming some wood to turn into energy
-First we build a Saw mill on a forest tile, to start gaining some wood

-Then we build a wood furnace to turn our wood into energy
-Now you can expand your base by building more saw mills and wood furnaces
-and later on you can start mining more efficient resources to turn into energy like Coal, Oil or Gas
-Al the while keep mining stone, because you'll need it to finish the game, by building a Fusion reactor
-Good luck and have fun trying the game yourself
